install the package using package manager

you can change the color of the material just by clicking and expanding the material options and selecting the required color from "MainColor" propertie's color pallet

Changing color through code at runtime

public SpriteRenderer _ColorChange;   (put any name u like for the rendered reference)
       
then call this function on the rendered reference to change the color of the material

 _ColorChange.material.SetColor("_MainColor",Color.red);

note("_MainColor") is important because it is a property of the shader that chages the color of the material make sure you spell it exactly as typed here

Also if you just want to change the Sprite color instead of the material use the Below given method

 _ColorChange.color = Color.red; (or any other colore reference u want to do as float or any other format)
